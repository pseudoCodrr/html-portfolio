<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! I'm Shantanu Rastogi (pseudoCodrr), a passionate and aspiring web developer on a journey to master full-stack
  development.
  My
  fascination with web technologies started with simple HTML and CSS projects, and I’ve been continuously expanding my
  skill set ever since.</p>

<p>Currently, I’m enrolled in <em>The Complete Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp</em> by Dr. Angela Yu, where I’m
  diving deep into front-end and back-end technologies. My goal is to create dynamic, user-friendly websites and
  applications that make a real impact.</p>

<p>This portfolio is a reflection of my growth as a developer, showcasing the projects I’ve built so far. I believe in
  continuous learning, problem-solving, and writing clean, efficient code.</p>

<p>When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new tech trends or brainstorming ideas for my next project. Feel free
  to connect with me—I’d love to collaborate and learn from fellow developers!</p>

<h2>Let’s build something amazing together!</h2>
