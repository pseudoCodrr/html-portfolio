<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>

<hr />

<h3>The Matrix (1999)</h3>
<p>This is my favourite sci-fi movie as it blows your mind and forces yoy to rethink out of the box.
    Once I was conveinced that someone outside of this world is controling us.</p>

<h3>Chhaava (2025)</h3>
<p>"Chhaava" (2025) is a grand and ambitious historical drama that brings to life the story of Chhatrapati Sambhaji
    Maharaj, a fierce warrior and the son of the legendary Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj. This film is a visual spectacle,
    a powerful tribute to a courageous leader, and a captivating exploration of a pivotal period in Indian history.</p>

<h3>Shaadi Mein Zaroor Aana (2017)</h3>
<p>This is a romantic drama film about a girl and a boy who are brought together by a marriage proposal and fall in love
    with each other but on the night of their marriage, destiny takes the two of them in two different directions. The
    movie is a perfect Bollywood film with love songs, romantic U-turns, 2 warring families and a an expected ending
    with a twist. </p>
